This github repo includes:
Matlab code for calculating RMSE (and other error metrics) on autolab data.

Change working folder and other filepaths for the lookup table code.

The provided makeLookupTable code requires all data files have the text _freq in the filename (this prevents attempts to process dotfiles in the folder). And can be run using Python.
